# Parser

A parser is a software component that processes input data, typically text, and builds a data structure, such as a parse tree or abstract syntax tree, which represents the syntactic structure of the input. The parser is often preceded by a lexer, which converts the input text into a sequence of tokens.

In our context the parser transform the nodes obtained after our lexical analysis. This nodes will be use to create another list of nodes that will gather the needed informations for the command execution.
